# Raytracer

![img1.png](res%2Fimg1.png)

## Running the project

Use CMake to compile and run in desired directory. Running the executable will output the image in a PPM 
file in the current working directory.

To adjust the number of threads to render image, edit the `num_threads` field in `camera.h`.

Still a work in progress.
